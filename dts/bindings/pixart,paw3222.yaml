description: PAW32xx ultra low power wireless mouse chip

compatible: "pixart,paw3222"

include: spi-device.yaml

properties:
  irq-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description:
      GPIO connected to the motion pin, active low.

  power-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: false
    description:
      GPIO connected to the power control pin.

  res-cpi:
    type: int
    description: |
      CPI resolution for the sensor. This can also be changed in runtime using
      the paw32xx_set_resolution() API.

  force-awake:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Initialize the sensor in "force awake" mode. This can also be enabled or
      disabled in runtime by the application using the paw32xx_force_awake()
      API.

  automouse-layer:
    type: int
    description: |
      Layer index to activate when movement is detected. When movement is
      detected above the threshold, the keyboard will automatically switch
      to this layer for mouse operations.

  scroll-layers:
    type: int
    description: |
      Layer index for scroll mode. When this layer is active, trackball
      movement will be converted to scroll wheel events.

  movement-timeout-ms:
    type: int
    default: 600
    description: |
      Milliseconds of inactivity before automatically returning to base layer.
      Set to 0 to disable timeout.

  movement-threshold:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      Minimum accumulated movement (in sensor units) required to trigger
      auto mouse layer activation. Lower values make the sensor more sensitive.
